It has a book detail dropdown option at the top where you can select the book you want to get details of;

You can hover on the graph also to get details of it.

Used New York Times API for the generation, I wanted to display price on the y-axis but since the price for all the books was 0.0 I used weeks on the list as the y-axis dimension.
